## News-Classification-using-Machine-Learning

In this notebook, we investigate the effectiveness of different
machine learning algorithms for news classification. Specifically,
it explores the performance of Multinomial Naive Bayes,
Random Forest, and Linear Support Vector Classification
(SVC) models on a news dataset. The study employs techniques
such as text preprocessing, TF-IDF feature extraction, and grid
search for hyperparameter optimization. Evaluation metrics
including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are utilized
to assess the modelsâ€™ performance. The findings contribute
to understanding the suitability of these algorithms for news
categorization tasks.
